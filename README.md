## Comments About the Code
- **HTML Structure**: Standard use of basic HTML tags and classed divs
- **CSS Layout**: Flexbox and grid are used for creating a responsive design. Media queries will ensure the design adapts to various screen sizes.
- **JavaScript (Planned)**: Currently, the project does not have interactive JavaScript. Future iterations will include scripts for the shopping cart and log in procedures.

## Test Plan
At this stage, manual testing will be conducted to ensure:
- Proper navigation between the homepage, products, and other sections.
- Product grid layout adjusts correctly for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Buttons like "Shop Now" and the form submit work as expected.

**Future Testing**:
- **Log in**: Test different permissions for admins and users
- **Shopping Cart and buying procedure**: Test if the shopping cart updates correctly
- **TBD**: Not yet determined

## Test Results
Initial manual tests will show:
- Navigation works smoothly between all sections.
- Product grid displays correctly on desktop and mobile views.
- Buttons and form fields are functional but not yet connected to a back-end.
